- The concept of sets dates back to the 1870s, developed by German mathematician **Georg Cantor**.  
- Set Theory is the foundation of **modern mathematics**, including probability (and statistics), algebra, and computer science.  
- In real life, even your Netflix recommendations are based on analyzing your **viewing history (sets)**!

# Interactive Set Theory Learning Module

This is an interactive learning module on set theory, built with Streamlit and Python. It was created as the final project for a Discrete Structures class.

---

## Features

* **Interactive Lessons**: Learn core concepts of set theory, including union, intersection, and complements.
* **Visualizations**: See how set operations work with real-time, dynamic visualizations.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: An easy-to-use interface designed for students.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your computer:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/DanielAsenso-G/set-theory-lms.git](https://github.com/DanielAsenso-G/set-theory-lms.git)
    cd set-theory-lms
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    * **On Windows**:
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit App**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run your_main_file_name.py
    ```
    (Note: Replace `your_main_file_name.py` with the actual name of your main Python script, e.g., `app.py` or `main.py`).
